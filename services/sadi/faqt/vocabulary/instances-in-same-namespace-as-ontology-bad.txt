I just wanted to point out that isn't a generally accepted practice to have your instances and ontology in the namespace:

<http://aquarius.tw.rpi.edu/essi-lod/instances/group_01>
    a <http://aquarius.tw.rpi.edu/essi-lod/instances/Cluster>

I'd suggest you rename <http://aquarius.tw.rpi.edu/essi-lod/instances/Cluster> to another namespace that is dedicated to your ontology.
